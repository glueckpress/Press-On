# Press On

All ye web dev and ye hipster folk<br>
gather round my piano young and old<br>
listen til my story has been told<br>
of how WordPress came to be<br>
Met Mike Little and Matt Mullenweg<br>
for Michel had not seemed to come back<br>
it’d be 2 men, 1 word, a fork, a hack<br>
and 0.7 would hit town<br>

_Ain’t no feed never be fetched to far<br>
for each line there is an expert bar<br>
not yet empty means half full a jar<br>
let’s add some action here<br>
While our query’s still 1 post ahead<br>
we democratize the internet<br>
and we’re nowhere near the end just yet<br>
press on, press on_

We got post and comment RSS<br>
.sticky shall precede the rest<br>
a page order field to sort the mess<br>
and a blogroll floats aside<br>
Old Kubrick kickin’ off the scene<br>
for 2010, 11, 12, 13<br>
14 got beat up black and green<br>
15’s queen of default<br>

_Ain’t no feed never be fetched to far…_

4 freedoms and the GPL<br>
and an A8c BDFL<br>
for some random dude ain’t work so well<br>
double you pee, drama smell<br>
But thank god that WordCamp whoop-de-do<br>
is coming to a city near  you too<br>
get a full charge of good people foo<br>
hashtag WCEU<br>

_Ain’t no feed never be fetched to far…_

Fast forward to 4.3<br>
there’s a feature everyone crave to see<br>
REST API’s the common plea<br>
just not yet in the mix<br>
First let’s customize the shit out of<br>
site icons and nav menu stuff<br>
mak’em passwords safe as 9" cuffs<br>
hash-space h2-6<br>

_Ain’t no feed never be fetched to far…_

In 4.4 that API<br>
hits core and WordPress learns to fly<br>
on JavaScript, react or die<br>
deeply undefined<br>
Progressively enhance all things<br>
give a11y a ride, she ain’t got wings<br>
translate 500,000 strings<br>
translate 500,000 strings<br>
translate 1,000,000 strings<br>
right now<br>

When the tale of WordPress is truly told<br>
the ink never, never dries out cold<br>
before you ship a verse it already got old<br>
we iterate all the things<br>
So let’s join in just 1 last chorus<br>
hack life til great devop come for us<br>
push, git -commit, yeah, this is it<br>
and the answer’s always grace<br>

_Ain’t no feed never be fetched to far…_
