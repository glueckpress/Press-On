Press On
---

All ye web dev and ye hipster folk
gather round my piano young and old
listen til my story has been told
of how WordPress came to be
Met Mike Little and Matt Mullenweg
for Michel had not seemed to come back
it’d be 2 men, 1 word, a fork, a hack
and 0.7 would hit town

Ain’t no feed never be fetched to far
for each line there is an expert bar
not yet empty means half full a jar
let’s add some action here
While our query’s still 1 post ahead
we democratize the internet
and we’re nowhere near the end just yet
press on, press on

We got post and comment RSS
.sticky shall precede the rest
a page order field to sort the mess
and a blogroll floats aside
Old Kubrick kickin’ off the scene
for 2010, 11, 12, 13
14 got beat up black and green
15’s queen of default

Ain’t no feed never be fetched to far…

4 freedoms and the GPL
and an A8c BDFL
for some random dude ain’t work so well
double you pee, drama smell
But thank god that WordCamp whoop-de-do
is coming to a city near  you too
get a full charge of good people foo
hashtag WCEU

Ain’t no feed never be fetched to far…

Fast forward to 4.3
there’s a feature everyone crave to see
REST API’s the common plea
just not yet in the mix
First let’s customize the shit out of
site icons and nav menu stuff
mak’em passwords safe as 9" cuffs
hash-space h2-6

Ain’t no feed never be fetched to far…

In 4.4 that API
hits core and WordPress learns to fly
on JavaScript, react or die
deeply undefined
Progressively enhance all things
give a11y a ride, she ain’t got wings
translate 500,000 strings
translate 500,000 strings
translate 1,000,000 strings
right now

When the tale of WordPress is truly told
the ink never, never dries out cold
before you ship a verse it already got old
we iterate all the things
So let’s join in just 1 last chorus
hack life til great devop come for us
push, git -commit, yeah, this is it
and the answer’s always grace

Ain’t no feed never be fetched to far…
